# Dota 2 GSI (Game State Integration)
A C# library to interface the Game State Integration found in Dota 2.

## What is Game State Integration

Game State Integration hasn't been officially released for Dota 2, but it has been available for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for a few months now. The concept is the same as CSGO's, you can read about [Counter-Strike Game State Integration here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration).

## About Dota 2 GSI

This library provides easy means of implementing Game State Integration from Dota 2 into C# applications. Library listens for HTTP POST requests made by the game on a specific address and port. Upon receiving a request, the game state is parsed and can be used.

JSON parsing is done though help of Newtonsoft's [JSON.Net Framework](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

After starting the `GameStateListener` instance, it will continuously listen for incoming HTTP requests. Upon a received request, the contents will be parsed into a `GameState` object.


## Installation
Via NuGet:

```
Install-Package Dota2GSI
```

Manual installation:

1. Get the [latest binaries](https://github.com/antonpup/Dota2GSI/releases/latest)  
2. Get the [JSON Framework .dll by Newtonsoft](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases)  
3. Extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll from `Bin\Net45\Newtonsoft.Json.dll`  
4. Add a reference to both Dota2GSI.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll in your project  

## Usage
1. Create a `GameStateListener` instance by providing a port or passing a specific URI:

```C#
GameStateListener gsl = new GameStateListener(3000); //http://localhost:3000/
GameStateListener gsl = new GameStateListener("http://127.0.0.1:81/");
```

**Please note**: If your application needs to listen to a URI other than `http://localhost:*/` (for example `http://192.168.2.2:100/`), you need to ensure that it is run with administrator privileges.  
In this case, `http://127.0.0.1:*/` is **not** equivalent to `http://localhost:*/`.

2. Create a handler:

```C#
void OnNewGameState(GameState gs)
{
    //do stuff
}
```

3. Subscribe to the `NewGameState` event:

```C#
gsl.NewGameState += new NewGameStateHandler(OnNewGameState);
```

4. Use `GameStateListener.Start()` to start listening for HTTP POST requests from the game client. This method will return `false` if starting the listener fails (most likely due to insufficient privileges).

```

### Item, and Hero names
Item and hero names are presented in their "internal name" format. A full list of item names can be found [here](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Item_names) and a full list of heroes can be located [here](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Hero_names).

##### Examples:
```C#
int Health = gs.Hero.Health; // 560
int MaxHealth = gs.Hero.MaxHealth; // 560
string HeroName = gs.Hero.Name; //npc_dota_hero_omniknight
int Level = gs.Hero.Level; //1

Console.WriteLine("You are playing as " + HeroName + " with " + Health + "/" + MaxHealth + " health and level " + Level);
//You are playing as npc_dota_hero_omniknight with 560/560 health and level 1

```

## Null value handling

In case the JSON did not contain the requested information, these values will be returned:

Type|Default value
----|-------------
int|-1
string| String.Empty

All Enums have a value `enum.Undefined` that serves the same purpose.

## Example program

A user, [judge2020](https://github.com/judge2020), has created an example program to demonstrate Dota2GSI functionalities. It can be found in the "Dota2GSI Example program" folder.
Video demonstration: 

[![Dota 2 GSI Exmaple Program Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/-58BSNLnXdA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-58BSNLnXdA)

## Example implementation - for api reference only

Prints "It is night time" when it is night time.

```C#
using Dota2GSI;
using System;

namespace DOTA2GSI_sample
{
    static class Program
    {
        GameStateListener gsl;
        
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            gsl = new GameStateListener(4000);
            gsl.NewGameState += new NewGameStateHandler(OnNewGameState);

            if (!gsl.Start())
            {
                System.Windows.MessageBox.Show("GameStateListener could not start. Try running this program as Administrator.\r\nExiting.");
                Environment.Exit(0);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Listening for game integration calls...");
        }

        static void OnNewGameState(GameState gs)
        {
            if(gs.Map.GameState == DOTA_GameState.DOTA_GAMERULES_STATE_GAME_IN_PROGRESS)
            {
                if(!gs.Map.IsDaytime || gs.Map.IsNightstalker_Night)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("It is night time");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You will also need to create a custom `gamestate_integration_*.cfg` in `game/dota/cfg/gamestate_integration/`, for example:  
`gamestate_integration_test.cfg`:  
```
"Dota 2 Integration Configuration"
{
    "uri"           "http://localhost:4000/"
    "timeout"       "5.0"
    "buffer"        "0.1"
    "throttle"      "0.1"
    "heartbeat"     "30.0"
    "data"
    {
        "provider"      "1"
        "map"           "1"
        "player"        "1"
        "hero"          "1"
        "abilities"     "1"
        "items"         "1"
    }
}

```

**Please note**: In order to run this test application without explicit administrator privileges, you need to use the URI `http://localhost:<port>` in this configuration file.
